- 👋 Hi, I’m @Redpressnet
- 👀 I’m interested in communications, media, social networking, cybersecurity, pentesting, coding, web design, comsci, all kinds!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a mix of things as I'm wofking on web design, social media, and content creation projects.
🎸📝 I'm a writer and a musician as well. Semi-professional on the writing end. I'm an amateur audio engineer and can work a DAW.
- 💞️ I’m looking to fundraise for my website rednet.press which is to be the frontier landmark for my social / media project called 'Redux In Press'.
- 💉 'Redux In Press' is a project in harm reduction for drug use and activism in Canadian drug policy. I also have affiliatinos with other major groups (far         greater in size and scope tham I am currently) and am starting up a business with 'RIP' called 'StripDown' which is in the sales of fentanyl test strips.
- 📫 You can reach me at reduxinpress@gmail.com
